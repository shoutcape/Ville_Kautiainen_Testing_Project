> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
-   I enjoyed testing the webapp and found it to be very educational.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
-   I just tried different outcomes manually for each test case
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -  I think a more thorough approach would be more beneficial and the use of test case management tools would also be recommended.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
-   I used VsCode to edit files


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-   I didn't experience any difficulties with the tasks.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I have used github before in my personal use and also for school so it was quite easy for me to use.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
-   I would probably use Selenium and Robot framework since I have used them in other automation projects as well.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
-   These are the skills I found: programming proficiency, logic & analytical skills, systemic bug reporting and familiarity with automation tools



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
-   Proficiency in automation tools like selenium, knowledge of scripting languages like python, experience in version control systems. For soft skills the things I should work on are attention to detail and analytical and problem solving capabilities.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-   Doing things hands-on made things clearer and solidified the theroretical knowledge. The lessons were full of good stuff, but maybe it'd be even better if there was more of the practical assignments during the course rather than only in the end. I learned a lot and see that testing is super important for the production of software.
